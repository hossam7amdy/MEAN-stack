# MERN Stack

Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.

Principal technologies used in the MERN stack include:

- MongoDB, a cross-platform document-oriented database program.
- Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js.
- React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js, an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime.
