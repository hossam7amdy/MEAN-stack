# Compound Pattern

Allows you to create components that all work together to perform a task. They’re dependent on each other through the shared state, and share logic together i.e. `select`, `dropdown`, and `menu items` components.

The compound pattern is great when you’re building a component library. You’ll often see this pattern when using UI libraries like [Ant](https://ant.design/).
