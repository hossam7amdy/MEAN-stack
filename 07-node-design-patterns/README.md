# Node.js Overview

Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime that allows developers to build scalable network applications using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

## What this book covers

**Chapter 01: _The Node.js Platform_**, serves as an introduction to the world of Node.js
application design by showing the patterns at the core of the platform itself. It covers
the Node.js ecosystem and its philosophy, and provides a quick introduction to the
Node.js internals and the reactor pattern.

**Chapter 02: _The Module System_**, dives into the module systems available in Node.js,
underlining the differences between CommonJS and the more modern ES modules
from the ECMAScript 2015 specification.

**Chapter 03: _Callbacks and Events_**, introduces the first steps towards learning
asynchronous coding and its patterns, discussing and comparing callbacks and
the event emitter (observer pattern).

**Chapter 04: _Asynchronous Control Flow Patterns with Callbacks_**, introduces a set of
patterns and techniques for efficiently handling asynchronous control flow in
Node.js using callbacks. This chapter teaches you some traditional ways to mitigate
the "callback hell" problem using plain JavaScript.

**Chapter 05: _Asynchronous Control Flow Patterns with Promises_ and Async/Await**,
progresses with the exploration of more sophisticated and modern asynchronous
control flow techniques.

**Chapter 06: _Coding with Streams_**, dives deep into one of the most important tools
in Node.js: streams. It shows you how to process data with transform streams
and how to combine them into different patterns.

**Chapter 07: _Creational Design Patterns_**, starts to explore the traditional design patterns
in Node.js. In this chapter, you will learn about some of the most popular creational
design patterns, namely the Factory pattern, the Revealing Constructor pattern, the
Builder pattern, and the Singleton pattern.

**Chapter 08: _Structural Design Patterns_**, continues the exploration of traditional design
patterns in Node.js, covering structural design patterns such as Proxy, Decorator,
and Adapter.

**Chapter 09: _Behavioral Design Patterns_**, concludes the conversation around traditional
design patterns in Node.js by introducing behavioral design patterns like Strategy,
State, Template, Middleware, Command, and Iterator.

**Chapter 10: _Universal JavaScript for Web Applications_**, explores one of the most
interesting capabilities of modern JavaScript web applications: being able to share
code between the frontend and the backend. Throughout this chapter, you will learn
the basic principles of Universal JavaScript by building a simple web application
using modern tools and libraries.

**Chapter 11: _Advanced Recipes_**, takes a problem-solution approach to show you how
some common coding and design intricacies can be approached with ready-to-use
solutions.

**Chapter 12: _Scalability and Architectural Patterns_**, teaches you the basic techniques and
patterns for scaling a Node.js application.

**Chapter 13: _Messaging and Integration Patterns_**, presents the most important messaging
patterns, teaching you how to build and integrate complex distributed systems using
Node.js and its ecosystem.
