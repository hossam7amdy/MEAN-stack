## What is Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

**JavaScript**

- Q: What are you JS?
- A: Single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent, event-driven runtime.

- Q: What do you have?
- A: I have call stack, event loop, callback queue, and other APIs.

- Q: Do `V8` ll stack, event loop, callback queue, and other APIs?
- A: No, `V8` is just a JS engine (has call stack and a heap).

## Reactor Pattern: _event-driven model_

![Visualization of the event-driven model.](./assets/image-1.png)

**Node.js** is written using the Reactor pattern, which provides what is commonly referred to as an event-driven model.

- After receiving the request from the EventLoop, the Event Demultiplexer decides what type of hardware I/O operation needs to be performed, based on the I/O request.
- The operation is delegated to the appropriate unit.
- When the operation is complete, the Event Demultiplexer receives a notification and places the result in the EventQueue.
- The EventLoop then retrieves the result from the EventQueue and executes the appropriate callback.

## Node.js Architecture

- Event Queues (Macrotasks, I/O Polling, Microtasks)
- Macrotasks = (Timers, I/O, Immediate, close events)
- Microtasks = (Promises, process.nextTick)

## Changes from Node v11

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout 1"));
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout 2");
  Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("promise resolve"));
});
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout 3"));
```

- Node v10: Timeout 1, Timeout 2, Timeout 3, promise resolve
- Node v20: Timeout 1, Timeout 2, promise resolve, Timeout 3

## CommonJS vs ES modules

```js
process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log("nextTick");
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("promise resolve");
});

console.log("console.log");
```

- CommonJs: console.log, nextTick, promise resolve
- ES modules: console.log, promise resolve, nextTick
- _NOTE:_ **ES modules** function asynchronously, meaning that when the program begins, it does not initiate solely as a program in the conventional CommonJS fashion.

## Libuv (thread pool)

Blocking and Non-Blocking I/O

libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O.

## DNS is problematic in Node.js

In Node.js, the dns.lookup function is a Blocking I/O operation when resolving hostnames.

## Custom Promises — Bluebird

_Why not natives?_

You may have noticed that people often utilize custom-written promises, such as Bluebird.js. However, Bluebird.js offers much more than just a set of useful methods. It distinguishes itself by providing advanced features, enhancing promise performance.
